# BitGray Technical Test

Using [JSON Placeholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) create a responsive application according to the instructions provided. This repo contains the code used to create this application. Further, the app has been uploaded to Heroku and can be viewed [here](http://graybit.herokuapp.com/index.html).

This repo also contains a [deployment diagram](https://github.com/gomezjuliana/graybit/blob/master/Diagrama%20de%20despliegue.pdf). As the application is quite simple and straightforward, I saw no need to use modules or frameworks and was able to meet the requirements using vanilla Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3.

In regards to the architecture used, I used IIFEs so as to not contaminate the global object.
